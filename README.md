# data-sourcing-challenge

This is a UNC-Chapel Hill AI Boot Camp assignment for Module 6. The assignment involves preparing data for a recommendation system to help users find movie reviews and related movies. It extracts data from two sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, and then merges the data. The extracted text can later be used with natural language processing methods.
